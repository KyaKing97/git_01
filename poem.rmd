The first day of Christmas,  
My true love sent to me  
A partridge in a pear tree.  

The second day of Christmas,  
My true love sent to me  
Two turtle doves, and  
A partridge in a pear tree.  

The third day of Christmas,  
My true love sent to me  
Three French hens,  
Two turtle doves, and  
A partridge in a pear tree.  

The fourth day of Christmas,  
My true love sent to me  
Four colly birds,  
Three French hens,  
Two turtle doves, and  
A partridge in a pear tree.
